# Unicode to ANSI Converter in Unity/C#
Bangla Text Unicode is not supported in Unity. For showing Unicode texts in Unity, we have made a converter to show the texts in ANSI format. The mapping is built by getting inspiration from [bn-ansi-to-unicode repository](https://github.com/BinduLogic/bn-ansi-to-unicode).
Please feel free to contribute to the converter if you'd like more improvement.

## How to Use
Import the class in your file, call the UnicodeToAnsi() function. And, conversion done!
